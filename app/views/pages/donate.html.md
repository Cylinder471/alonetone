## alonetone is now a nonprofit

I started alonetone 15 years ago. I ran a few similar things before, but in 2005 it became very clear that the internet had rendered music distribution costs essentially free. Why not build a free service (as in gratis and libre) for myself, my friends, and anyone else who wanted to join.

Other sites (like soundcloud) launched around the same time we did. However they were clearly a business. I felt strongly that the internet was finally reaching a place where there was simply no need for business to be involved. Musicians should be able to share their music freely among friends and fans. They just needed some infrastructure to accomplish this.

I've kept this site running as the primary developer for just about 15 years. The site has served over almost 6 million streams of 90,000 tracks from 6500 artists. That might be peanuts on the global internet scale, but it's also pretty amazing that one person can deliver this in their part time. A true testament to what's possible. The number of friendships evolved, connections made and lives changed by the site have been both unexpected and humbling.

Of course alonetone was built with a lot of help. A close designer friend. A talented frontend dev who also handles some of the community aspects. And dozens and dozens of motivated early users who contributed time and effort to help shape it into a home.

Things weren't always smooth. There were many times where alonetone didn't get the attention it deserves, socially or technically. There are many features that we *still* haven't had the bandwidth to build (comment replies!). I got busy or didn't have enough money to hire the help the site deserves or a feature fell into disrepair.

Other times have been great. In 2017-2019, my consulting business was going well. I decided to do a big alonetone modernization. I contracted a few talented people (who graciously discounted their rates) and we overhauled almost every aspect of the app. I restricted my consulting to part time and invested hundreds and hundreds of hours on the refresh. In addition to my time, I personally spent over 100k for help over these 3 years.

I made this investment and the others before it because the internet *needs* projects like this. We *need* high quality free and non-commercial options. We shouldn't just leave these services to startups and companies looking to profit as middlemen. Open source needs to serve more than just business needs, it needs to serve community needs.

There used to be so many more indie sites like alonetone on the internet! A lot of them running modified forums or custom built software, some even open source. But almost all have shut down. Maintaining and developing a web application is *not* trivial, especially as time passes and technology changes. And it's far from free. It's straight up risky for a communal venue to depend completely on one person's financial situation.

Recognizing this, I setup a Patreon in 2019 and asked the community if they could cover the server and related costs, which they happily did! However, hard costs are 1-2k/year and pale in comparison with the human time involved. Properly maintaining the site requires regular effort from a backend dev, a frontend dev and a designer.

What does that mean, realistically? With my years of experience running the project, I can confidently say it takes a minimum of $20-40k/year to properly maintain the site (with myself still working for free). It takes at least $50-100k/year to actually move the site forward measurably, to build new features, be able to support community growth, etc.

I still believe 100% in alonetone's original premise: the internet has rendered music distribution essentially free. That's had an amazing impact on my generation and the generations following. I know others believe strongly in this too, because they tell me all the time.

So, I'm proud to say we've finally made the leap. alonetone is now officially built by ModernThings, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit started by myself, alonetone's longtime frontend dev and one of the original believers in the project. We are now accepting tax deductible donations in the US and donations worldwide.

If you believe in our mission and want alonetone to remain a shining example of what the internet can be, we'd be honored if you would invest in us. Help us continue to build a bright future for musicians worldwide.
